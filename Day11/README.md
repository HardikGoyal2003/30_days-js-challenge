# Drag and Drop Feature

Welcome to the Drag and Drop Feature project repository! This project showcases how to implement a simple and interactive drag-and-drop functionality in a web application. Drag and drop is a powerful user interface pattern that allows users to intuitively interact with elements on a page.

## Features

- **Draggable Elements**: Make any HTML element draggable within the designated area.
- **Drop Targets**: Define drop targets where draggable elements can be dropped.
- **Customizable Styling**: Easily customize the appearance and style of both draggable elements and drop targets.
- **Event Handling**: Implement event listeners to respond to drag and drop events.
