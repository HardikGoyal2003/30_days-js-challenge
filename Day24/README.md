# Image Search Engine

Welcome to the Image Search Engine project repository! This project is a simple image search engine that allows users to explore and discover images based on their queries. It leverages an external API to retrieve images and provides a user-friendly interface for searching and viewing results.

## Features

- **Image Search**: Enter a search query to retrieve relevant images.
- **Display Search Results**: View a grid of images based on the search query.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through multiple pages of search results.
- **Responsive Design**: The search engine is designed to work seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes.

## External API

This project uses the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to retrieve images based on search queries. Unsplash is a high-quality image provider that offers a vast collection of images contributed by photographers around the world. To use the Unsplash API, you'll need to sign up for an API key and replace the placeholder in the JavaScript code with your own key.
