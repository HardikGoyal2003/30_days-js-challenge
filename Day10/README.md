# Toast Notification Feature

Welcome to the Toast Notification Feature project repository! This project demonstrates how to implement a simple and customizable toast notification system in a web application. Toast notifications are used to display non-intrusive messages to users, providing feedback or alerting them to certain events.

## Features

- **Customizable Toasts**: Create and display toast notifications with customizable content, duration, and appearance.
- **Position Control**: Specify where on the screen the toast notifications should appear (top, bottom, left, right).
- **Queue Management**: Manage the display queue to handle multiple toast notifications without overlapping.
- **Dismiss Option**: Allow users to manually dismiss toast notifications before the set duration.
