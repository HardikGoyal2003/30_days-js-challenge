# 30 Days JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to the 30 Days JavaScript Challenge repository! In this challenge, I'll be uploading a small JavaScript project every day for 30 days. Each project is designed to help improve my JavaScript skills and explore various concepts and libraries.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by day, with a separate folder for each day's project. Each project folder contains the following:

1. **`README.md`**: A brief description of the project, its purpose, and key features.

2. **`index.html`**: The HTML file for the project.

3. **`style.css`**: The CSS file for styling the project (if applicable).

4. **`script.js`**: The JavaScript file where the project logic is implemented.

5. **`images/`**: A directory for any project-specific assets, such as images or additional files.

6. **`screenshots/`**: A directory for screenshots or images of the project .

## Table of Contents

## Getting Started

To view and run a project, navigate to the respective day's folder (e.g., `Day01/`) and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can also check the `README.md` for additional information about each project.

Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from the code. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to create an issue or reach out to me.

## Goals

The primary goals of this challenge are:

1. Improve my JavaScript programming skills.
2. Explore various JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and APIs.
3. Develop a portfolio of small projects that showcase my skills.
4. Share my progress and knowledge with the community.

Happy coding!
